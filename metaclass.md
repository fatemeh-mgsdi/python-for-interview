## Metaclass
In Python, a metaclass is a class that defines the behavior of other classes. More specifically, a metaclass is a class that creates and controls the behavior of other classes.

When you define a class in Python, the default metaclass is the type class. However, you can create your own metaclasses by subclassing type and defining your own behavior.

Metaclasses can be used to customize the behavior of classes in various ways. For example, you can use a metaclass to add or remove attributes from a class, to enforce certain constraints on the class definition, or to modify the class hierarchy.

Here's a simple example of a metaclass that enforces a naming convention for classes:

In this example, the NamingConventionMetaclass checks that the name of any class created with it starts with the prefix "My". If a class is defined without this prefix, it raises a ValueError.
